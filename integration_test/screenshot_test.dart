/// Test taking a screenshot from a running Flutter app.
/// 
/// Part of a Github project https://github.com/mzimmerm/screenshot 
/// which duplicates an issue reported on Flutter.
/// 
/// # Issue description (tl;dr): 
///   Presence of a directory named `example` on project top level causes to fail the `flutter drive ..` integration test.
///   This is very specific to the directory name `example`. The contents of the directory does not matter - just 
///   the presence of it Directories with other names do not cause this issue.
///   Worse, this failure prevents library projects to contain a example app, which by convention should be in a directory 
///   named `example`.
/// 
/// I created a project on Github  https://github.com/mzimmerm/screenshot 
/// which can be used to duplicate the issue.
/// The project is a rudimentary Flutter example app created from command line,
/// with added files `test_driver/integration_test.dart` and `integration_test/screenshot_test.dart`.
/// 
/// # To duplicate the issue: 
/// Install the duplication project from Github as follows:
///    - On your local system, from the command line, run the following commands:
///    
/// ```shell
///   cd ~/tmp # create if not exist
///   git clone https://github.com/mzimmerm/screenshot.git
///   cd screenshot
///   # Note that the project top level does NOT contain a directory named `example`.
///   
///   # Clean and run the test (which creates a screenshot) from command line
///   flutter clean
///   flutter emulator --launch "Nexus_6_API_29_2" # Change the emulator name to one on your system 
///   sleep 25 # make sure the emulator starts fully
///   
///   # Run the added Flutter integration (drive) test which creates a screenshot of the app
///   flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/screenshot_test.dart
///   # Expected: screenshot-1.png is created in the project top level
///   # Actual:   screenshot-1.png is created in the project top level
///   
///   # Remove the screenshot to ensure we continue from the same initial state
///   rm screenshot-1.png
///   # Exit the emulator to ensure we continue from the same initial state.
///   
///   # Now create an empty directory `example` which will cause the same test to fail
///   
///   mkdir example
///  
///   # Run the same test as above again
///   # Clean and run the test (which creates a screenshot) from command line
///   flutter clean
///   flutter emulator --launch "Nexus_6_API_29_2" # Change the emulator name to one on your system 
///   sleep 25
///   flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/screenshot_test.dart
///   # Expected: screenshot-1.png is created in the project top level
///   # Actual:   Build exception: 
///   
///   #    ~/tmp/screenshot/android/app/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.java:19: error: package dev.flutter.plugins.integration_test does not exist
///   #    flutterEngine.getPlugins().add(new dev.flutter.plugins.integration_test.IntegrationTestPlugin()); ^
///   #    1 error
///   #    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. 
///  
///   # Note: renaming `example` to `example1` or any other name makes the test to work again.
/// ```

/// Supplemental information: The project https://github.com/mzimmerm/screenshot on Github

///   # - Added directory and file `integration_test/screenshot_test.dart`
///   #   as described in https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/integration_test#integration_test.
///   #   (alternative in https://dev.to/mjablecnik/take-screenshot-during-flutter-integration-tests-435k is almost the same 
///   #   and also does not work)
///   # - Added directory and file `test_driver/integration_test.dart`
